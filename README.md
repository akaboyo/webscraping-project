# [TOP 100 COMPANIES IN THE US](#top-100-companies-in-the-us)

## Project Overview

This project involves building a Python-based web scraper to collect data on the top 100 companies in the United States. The aim is to gather key information such as company names, market capitalization, industry sectors, and financial performance metrics. The scraped data was exported to a csv file for further analysis, reporting, and integrated into financial dashboards.

#### Key Components:
1. Web Scraping Libraries: In this project, i utilized these Python libraries:
   - BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML content and extracting data from the webpage.
   - requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch the HTML content.
   - pandas: For cleaning and organizing the data in a structured format (dataframe) and exporting it to CSV.
  
3. Data Collection: The scraper fetches data on:
   - Company Name
   - Ranking
   - Industry Sector
   - Revenue (USD millions)
   - Revenue Growth
   - No. of Employees
   
4. Data Storage: The scraped data is cleaned and stored in a CSV structured format, for further analysis in Tableau.

## Data Analysis

Once collected, i analysed the data to find trends in industries, company performance, and created visual reports using Tableau.

This project showcases my practical web scraping, data handling, and analysis skills that can be applied to financial market research or business intelligence applications.
 
See below a snippet of the scraped data which was exported to a csv file for further analysis.
