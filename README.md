# [TOP 100 COMPANIES IN THE US](#top-100-companies-in-the-us)

## Project Overview

This project involves building a Python-based web scraper to collect data on the top 100 companies in the United States. The aim is to gather key information such as company names, industry sectors, and financial performance metrics and employee size, uncover key insights into industry distribution, geographic concentration, and growth patterns. The scraped data was exported to a csv file for further analysis, reporting, and integrated into financial dashboards with the objective of providing stakeholders with a deeper understanding of:

- The distribution of revenue across industries and states.
- Which industries and companies contribute the most to overall revenue and employee counts.
- How revenue growth varies across companies and industries, particularly identifying which sectors are growing fastest and which companies dominate their respective sectors.
- Identifying geographic trends in the location of company headquarters and state-level revenue distributions.
- What are the relationships between company size (in terms of employees) and revenue in different industries?

By answering these questions, this project aims to provide actionable insights to help businesses and analysts understand the economic landscape of the largest U.S. companies and identify opportunities for growth and investment.

## Data Preprocessing
1. Web Scraping Libraries: In this project, i utilized these Python libraries:
   - BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML content and extracting data from the webpage.
   - requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch the HTML content.
   - pandas: For cleaning and organizing the data in a structured format (dataframe) and exporting it to CSV.
  
3. Data Collection: The scraper fetches data on:
   - Company Name
   - Ranking
   - Industry Sector
   - Revenue (USD millions)
   - Revenue Growth
   - No. of Employees
   
4. Data Storage: The scraped data is cleaned and stored in a CSV structured format, for further analysis in Tableau.

## Data Analysis

Once collected, i analysed the data to find trends in industries, company performance, and created visual reports using Tableau.

This project showcases my practical web scraping, data handling, and analysis skills that can be applied to financial market research or business intelligence applications.
 
See below a snippet of the scraped data which was exported to a csv file for further analysis.
